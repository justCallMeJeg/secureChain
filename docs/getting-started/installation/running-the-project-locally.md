# Running the Project Locally

{% hint style="info" %}
Project repository must be install before running it locally to your machine. If not yet installed, read [this page](./).
{% endhint %}

Before we start running the application locally, you need the following prerequisites:

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)

After installing the repository, open the built-in terminal in Visual Studio Code by pressing: `Ctrl` + `~` on your keyboard; then type: `npm install` . This command will install all required node dependencies to run the application.
